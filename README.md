# Project Name
> Melonoma Detection :  Building a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The dataset comprises 2357 images depicting malignant and benign oncological conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images were categorized based on the classification provided by ISIC, with each subset containing an equal number of images.



## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 :
    1. The model's training accuracy shows a steady increase of upto 90%, while validation accuracy remains consistently around 55%.
    2. A high training accuracy suggests the model has effectively captured the noise within the data. However, its poor performance on validation data 
       indicates a   lack    of generalizability.
    3. These observations confirm the presence of overfitting. To address this issue, augmentation techniques will be employed. Given the limited training
       data available, new samples will be generated by making slight modifications to existing data (such as horizontal/vertical image flipping, minor 
       image rotations, etc.), which will then be used for training the model.

- Conclusion 2 :
    1. By leveraging augmented data, overfitting has been effectively addressed.
    2. The training and validation accuracy of the aforementioned model fall within a similar range.
    3. Both the training and validation data are showing poor performance, indicating that the model is now exhibiting underfitting.

- Conclusion 3 :
    1. A clear class imbalance is evident within the training data.
    2. The class "seborrheic keratosis" comprises the smallest proportion of samples, accounting for approximately 3.44%.
    3. "Pigmented benign keratosis" and "melanoma" significantly outweigh other classes, representing approximately 20.63% and 19.56% of the data, respectively.

- Conclusion 4 :
   1. Implementing batch normalization in the model yielded a slight uptick in both training and validation accuracy.
   2. Formulating an alternative model without batch normalization aims to investigate prospective improvements in accuracy.

- Conclusion 5 :
   1. The ultimate model showcases well-balanced performance, displaying no signs of underfitting or overfitting.
   2. The implementation of class rebalancing has notably enhanced the model's performance across both training and validation datasets.
   3. Following 24 epochs, the final model attains an accuracy of 78% on the training set and approximately 76% on the validation set.
   4. The narrow divergence between training and validation accuracies underscores the robust generalization capability of the final CNN model.
   5. The addition of batch normalization failed to enhance both training and validation accuracy.
